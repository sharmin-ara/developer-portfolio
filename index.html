            <p>
                I was born in December, 1974, in Rajshahi--a beautiful town of Bangladesh, situated at the bank of river
                Padma. Along with my three
                siblings I spent my first eighteen years in Rajshahi University campus as my parents were faculties of
                RU.
                Among the four I am the youngest one. After completion of H. Sc., I came to Dhaka to study EEE in
                <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BUET</a>. I did my M.
                Sc. from <a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern
                    Illinoise University</a> , Carbondale, USA and Ph. D from <a
                    href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/">BUET</a>. I used
                teach undergrad for the last twelve years. I love to travel with my family and friends, and watching
                movies.

            <p>This would be my first unedited travelouge about Bangladesh. As a nature lover I enjoy to travel mostly
                in Sylhet and Chittagong division. The following link will
                provide a brief introduction about our riverine country.</p>
