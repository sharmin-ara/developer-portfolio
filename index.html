            <p>
                I was born in 6th of December, 1974, in Rajshahi--a beautiful town of Bangladesh. Along with my three
                siblings I spent my first eighteen years in Rajshahi University campus as my parents were faculties of
                RU.
                Among the four I am the youngest one. I think we all lived an exceptionally exciting and happy
                childhood.

            <h3>Destination Bangladesh</h3>
            <p>This would be my first unedited travelog about Bangladesh. Personally I love mountain over ocean. I am
                a nature lover too. One of my favourite destination is tea gardens in Sylhet. The following link will
                provide a brief introduction about that region.</p>
